      The following components exist but are not wired together:

      | Component | Location | Purpose |
      |-----------|----------|---------|
      | PlotViewer | `src/lib/components/PlotViewer.svelte` | Wraps PlotEditor + IsometricView + TimeScrubber |
      | PlotEditor | `src/lib/components/PlotEditor.svelte` | Obstacle placement UI |
      | IsometricView | `src/lib/components/IsometricView.svelte` | 3D shadow visualization |
      | TimeScrubber | `src/lib/components/TimeScrubber.svelte` | Time control for shadow animation |
      | Results page | `src/routes/results/+page.svelte` | Shows sun data, climate, recommendations |
      | Shade calc | `src/lib/solar/sun-hours-shade.ts` | Calculates effective sun hours with obstacles |
      | Recommendations | `src/lib/plants/recommendations.ts` | Generates plant suggestions |

      The results page currently shows theoretical sun hours. It needs to incorporate obstacle/slope data and show effective sun hours instead.

    title: Integrate PlotViewer into results page
    story: S-019
    description: Research at `docs/knowledge/research/app-integration.md` identified the integration point and data flow. PlotViewer should appear between the sun data card (line 124) and climate data section (line 126) in `src/routes/results/+page.svelte`.

    title: Optimize PlotViewer for mobile layout
    story: S-019
    description: Research at `docs/knowledge/research/app-integration.md` section R5 documents that PlotViewer has a 600px minimum height which consumes the entire viewport on phones. The recommended approach is a collapsed state that expands on tap.

    title: Add integration tests for full flow
    story: S-019
    description: Research at `docs/knowledge/research/app-integration.md` section R6 identified gaps in test coverage. Existing tests cover shade calculations and recommendations separately but not the integrated flow.
