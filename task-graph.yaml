    title: Create garden planner view exposing MapPicker features
    story: S-022
    description: |-
      S-020 built powerful features into MapPicker:
      - ShadeMap layer with real terrain/building shadows
      - Tree placement with draggable markers
      - Tree shadow compositing
      - Observation point selector
      - Time scrubber for shadow animation
      - localStorage persistence

      **None of these are visible to users.** LocationInput uses MapPicker with default props, which hides all the planning features. The component works, but there's no UI path to use it.
